"Travelling,
 A Way of Life, lets you escape the normal, boring life for sometime and teaches You to be alive again."
~The Moody Musafir.
<br>
<br>


To Some People, travelling is not just exploring new places , its a medicine. When life gets too tough on me, with flows of random sadness, loneliness and depressing thoughts, I prefer to travel as my way to take a break. It brings me new rays of hope, renews my energy to deal with everything and boosts up my confidence every time.
On journeys when I meet new faces with same state of mind, I realize that neither of us is alone, we are all in one or another fix.
Though this doesn't mean i choose to travel only when I'm low. Even in my brightest times, I would still prefer knowing new people , exploring local cuisines, seeing unknown face turn to friends as that has always brought me joy alongside experience . That's how i would express my Love for travelling.
Exploring has my heart and soul, keeps me at peace, and lets me rediscover myself.

Judging a place and its people before and after visiting them can bring out whole lot of differences, a single visit can change our whole mindset. Traveling is an endless source of inspiration and joy. Traveling helps us see the bigger picture, connect with people on different cultures and learn new skills. Through travel we can see what we have in common with other human beings around the world, it also allows us to discover new places, cultures, traditions and people. One of the best things about travel is getting to know yourself again after you come back home.
 People who have never been to North-east have always had a stereotypical age old knowledge of our looks, food habits and culture, while anyone who has made a single trip to this secluded part has a complete different view point. Traveling has played an important role in shaping the person you are. The places and people you come across, no matter how disparate they might be, can leave an indelible mark on your mind. Making these two closely connected things happen is easier said than done; though no one can deny their importance or beauty.
<br>
We, at Raahi~ Ek safar attempt to bring this peace of mind by making short plans of trekking, hiking and exploring places with small, friendly groups where you can make new experiences at pocket friendly costs.
